# simple-weather

Hi Karolin!

Thanks again for coming in today, Emma and I enjoyed looking through your past work and discussing our studio with you. As promised, hereâs the code challenge! Please complete by Wednesday June 29th, end of day. If you finish sooner, by all means, you can send it whenever youâre done.

Weather Forecast

Build a browser based JavaScript application that presents the user with an input for a zip code, and a submit button. When the user submits that input, the app should make a call to Google's Geocoding API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start), and pull the latitude and longitude from the result. At this point, please make a call to the Forecast API (https://developer.forecast.io/), using the resulting dataâs latitude and longitude values. Please render, below the input, the seven day forecast, and below that, the hourly forecast for the current day.

In each cell of the seven day forecast, please print out the temperature, the apparentTemperature (this would be the âFeels like x degâ), the summary (âPartly Cloudyâ), and an icon that represents that summary.

For the hourly cells, please print the time in standard human readable 12 hour format, the summary field with an icon again, and, of course, the temperature.

Iâd like to see this done in vanilla JavaScript, and use a css file (no bootstrap) to apply minimal styling with flex box and whatever you have the time for. Thanks again, and please feel free to let me know if you have any questions about the challenge, or anything else about the studio!
